### 1. **Define Scope and Features**

To avoid being overwhelmed, start by breaking down the project into stages. Include the advanced features gradually as you build the core functionality.

#### **Core Features** :

* User Authentication (Admin, Manager, Team Members)
* Task and Project Management (Create, Update, Delete tasks/projects)
* Task assignment to team members
* Task status tracking (To-Do, In Progress, Done)
* Task prioritization (High, Medium, Low)
* Task deadlines
* Dashboard for task/project overview
* Role-based access control
* File attachments to tasks
* Notifications for task assignments and updates

#### **Advanced Features** :

* **Kanban Board** : Drag-and-drop interface for visual task management.
* **Real-Time Collaboration** : Use **Socket.io** to allow multiple users to view and collaborate on tasks in real-time.
* **Time Tracking** : Implement a time tracking feature where users can log time spent on tasks.
* **Task Dependencies** : Create dependencies between tasks (e.g., one task cannot be started until another is completed).
* **Analytics and Reporting** : Provide project and task reports with visual charts for managers.
* **Mobile-Friendly UI** : Ensure the UI is fully responsive for mobile devices.
* **Email Notifications** : Use **Nodemailer** to send task updates and deadline reminders via email.

### 2. **Project Structure**

#### **Frontend** :

1. **React.js** for building dynamic, responsive user interfaces.
2. **Libraries** :

* **React Router** for navigation.
* **Axios** for API requests.
* **Bootstrap or Material-UI** for designing a clean UI.
* **Socket.io-client** for real-time task updates.
* **D3.js** or **Chart.js** for displaying reports and charts (for advanced analytics).
* **Redux** (optional, for complex state management) or **React Context** for simpler state management.

#### **Backend** :

1. **Node.js** and **Express.js** for building the API and handling user requests.
2. **MongoDB** for storing user, project, and task data.
3. **Nodemailer** for email notifications.

* Allow team members to upload and view files on each task.
* **Email Notifications** :
* Use **Nodemailer** to send emails for task assignments and deadline reminders.
* Set up background jobs with **Node-Cron** to send automatic reminders.

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features (Part 2)**

* **Time Tracking** :
* Allow users to log hours spent on each task.
* Display time logs on the task detail page.
* Provide reports to managers with total time spent per task/project.
* **Task Dependencies** :
* Create a system where tasks can depend on the completion of others.
* Block task status updates if a dependent task is incomplete.
* **Dashboard Analytics and Reports** :
* Use **D3.js** or **Chart.js** to visualize project progress, task distribution, and team performance.
* Show the total number of tasks by status, upcoming deadlines, and overdue tasks.
* Provide downloadable reports for managers.
* **Mobile-Responsive UI** :
* Ensure that the app is fully responsive by using CSS media queries or Material-UI's Grid system.

#### **Phase 4: Testing and Deployment**

* **Testing** :
* Write unit and integration tests using **Jest** (for frontend) and **Mocha/Chai** (for backend).
* Test all API endpoints and ensure correct role-based access control.
* **Deployment** :
* Deploy the backend using **Heroku** or  **AWS EC2** .
* Deploy the frontend using **Vercel** or  **Netlify** .
* Use **MongoDB Atlas** for the cloud database.

### 4. **Database Schema Enhancements**

You can refine your database schema to support advanced features like dependencies, time tracking, and file attachments.

#### **Tasks (Updated Schema)** :
